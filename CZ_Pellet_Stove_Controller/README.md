# Climate Czar Pellet Stove Controller
Raspberry Pi Zero W powered pellet stove controller for any single or dual auger pellet or bio-fuel fired stove or boiler.

This system works with any network enabled Raspberry Pi or even clones **_(also tested on a Banana Pi BPI-M2-Zero)_**. Designed using an England's Stove Works 25-PDV pellet stove which has both upper and lower augers where the lower auger runs continuously. In my case, I just run the lower auger motor and combustion blower both on the same relay.
