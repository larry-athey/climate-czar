# climate-czar
Universal remote climate monitoring and control system for greenhouses and indoor grow operations.

Climate Czar is a Linux and Wordpress based system that gathers readings from any type of sensor or switch that can be read with a bash script, whether it is a local device connected to a GPIO bus or a network device. This system will run effectively on a Raspberry PI with a LAMP stack and anything else up to a high performance virtual private server.
