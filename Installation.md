## Installation

Climate Czar Server requires a Debian derivative Linux operating system in order to run its installer script. If you use Centos/Fedora or Arch, I'm sorry, feel free to modify the installer script to support your Linux distribution.

`git clone https://github.com/larry-athey/climate-czar`

`cd climate-czar/Undercarriage`

`./install.sh`
