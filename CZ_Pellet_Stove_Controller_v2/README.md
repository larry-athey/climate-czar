# CZ Pellet Stove Controller v2

While this project is a sub-component of Climate Czar, this pellet stove controller will run perfectly fine by itself, no need for a Climate Czar server. It is only included as a sub-component of Climate Czar since I use it in my greenhouse to manage the water temperature in my fish tanks. My greenhouse pellet stove is actually converted to a low-grade boiler, the heat that comes off the outside of the stove doesn't really provide much benefit. The England Stove Works controller died on me and I wasn't going to pay $300 for a new one when theirs doesn't have any kind of WiFi connectivity.
