These models are geared for 1/4 IBC flood and drain beds and shown in Rob Bob's video on Chop and Flip Aquaponics systems. Rob's design uses a 3/4" stand pipe which is what the Stand-Pipe-Funnel.stl model is meant to be attached to. I recommend gluing this to the top your stand pipe flush with the bottom of the funnel's bowl. This helps create a more reliable siphon lock so you don't end up with a siphon that won't start.

Chop-n-Flip-Bell.stl has a built-in siphon break tube so you don't end up with a siphon that won't stop. This will work with a stand pipe (with the funnel) up to 8" tall, adjust the height as needed to work with your media level.

I recommend printing these model with PETG filament using triple walls in order to reduce the amount of air inside the walls, so the bell isn't likely to float when the bed fills up with water.
