No, these aren't actually part of Climate Czar, these are just being hosted here for easy download by people who have asked me for them. These models are geared for 1/4 IBC flood and drain beds and shown in Rob Bob's video on [Chop and Flip Aquaponics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_VROMhAoSs) systems.

Rob's design uses a 3/4" stand pipe which is what the **Stand-Pipe-Funnel.stl** model is meant to be attached to. I recommend gluing this to the top your stand pipe flush with the bottom of the funnel's bowl. This helps create a more reliable siphon lock so you don't end up with a siphon that won't start.

**Chop-n-Flip-Bell.stl** has a built-in siphon break tube so you don't end up with a siphon that won't stop. This will work with a stand pipe (with the funnel) up to 8" tall. Adjust the stand pipe height as needed to work with your media level. My stand pipe is 6-1/2" tall and the PVC slip fitting at the bottom raises the top to 7".

I recommend printing these models with PETG filament using triple walls in order to reduce the amount of air inside the walls. This is so the bell isn't likely to float when the bed fills up with water. PETG isn't recommended because of the whole "food safe plastic" bit, it's actually because PETG is more dense than PLA and ABS and doesn't float in water with no air in the walls.
